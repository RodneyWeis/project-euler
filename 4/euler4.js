/*  A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
    The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

    Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

    NOTE:  My solution is going to exhaustively calculate each combination of two 3-digit numbers.
    This is neither efficient nor the quickest way to reach the answer, but it is thorough.
